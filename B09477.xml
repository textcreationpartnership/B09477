            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:192293:4"/>
               <hi>Day of Love,</hi> beyond all Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which I am, from time to time, moved of the Lord to call into Remembrance in the Ears of his People; it's a <hi>Day</hi> never to be forgotten: For if the <hi>Day</hi> of outward <hi>Israel</hi>'s Visitation, in outward <hi>Egypt,</hi> was to be kept in a continued Remembrance, how much more ought the <hi>Day</hi> of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation of Spiritual <hi>Israel,</hi> in Spiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> in Spiritual <hi>Thraldom,</hi> under the Spiritual <hi>Task-masters,</hi> to be kept in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Remembrance.</p>
            <p>And dear Friends, You know what manner of entrance Truth made in its first Appearance, in the <hi>Day</hi> of our first tender Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation; how it regarded not
<pb facs="tcp:192293:5"/> the empty Profession of any, but broke in upon us, pricking us to the Heart, bringing us to a true Sence of our inward States and Conditions before the Lord; where, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the fair Shews of Professions, we saw our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls in Death, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Grave of Sin, and the Nature of Transgression Exalted above all that was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God in us; and we had not only a fight of this our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable State, but also a sight of him whom we had Pierced, and whose Countenance we saw Marred more than any Man's, and his Visage more than the Sons of Men; and here many knew a Day of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192293:5"/> Mourning, and a passing thro' a Vail of Tears, and a Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Cup of Trembling from the Hand of the Lord; for, our awakened Souls cried unto the Lord, to be eased from under the Burden and Load of Iniquity, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Lord God bowed down his Ear to the Cry of his <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and manifested his Mighty Out-stretched Arm of Power, which wrought in us mightily, for the killing and making alive, for the casting down and raising up; and because of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and operating of the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Power of the Immortal God, our very Tabernacles Trembled, so as that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as Signs and Wonders to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192293:6"/> People, yea, to our very Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Relations: For we were as a People separated from all Comforts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. And, my dear Friends, although it was thus with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet it was a good Day; for the Judgments of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Earth, many learned Righteousness: And as this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Power was Bowed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and Lived in, it brought forth the Soul out of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Pit, which was an Answer to the Cries of the Panting Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Hearts and Souls of many.</p>
            <p>And so, dear Friends, as the Lord God began an effectual Work by his Immortal, Living, Glorious Power, so hath he, by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192293:6"/> the same, been carrying it on these many Years amongst us, notwithstanding the great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions it hath met with every way by the Power or Darkness, in them that went out from us, and from Men without, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and various Persecutions.</p>
            <p>Ah! How hath <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that crooked Serpent, wrought? Under how many Disguises ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h he appeared in, to Rend and Devour? How many false Spirits hath he appeared in? And what endeavour hath the Old Serpent made to lay waste the Heritage of God? But, Blessed for ever be the Name of the Mighty God, who is laying waste that Serpentine Spirits working, and will lay
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192293:7"/> it waste, and tread it down for ever, under the Feet of his Anointed; and will make all their Skirts bare, who have called themselves <hi>Jews,</hi> and were not, but were, and are of the Synagogue of Satan, who would have Perverted the Right Way of the Lord, and would have risen up in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Enmity of the Old Crooked Serpent, against the Servants and Messengers of the Everlasting God, whom they have caused to go with Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down Souls before the Lord: Friends, against that Spirit, in its Root and Branches, I have a certain Testimony from the Eternal God (who Lives for ever) to bear: And Wo from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:192293:7"/> God to the Vessels that are still Polluted with that Spirit.</p>
            <p>And, dear Friends, not only this Mercy have we received from the Hand of the Lord, to wit, The treading down of the Serpentine Spirit, which indeed I cannot but say, is not one of the least of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Kindnesses of our God; but as the Lord hath Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wonderful in Power for our inward Deliverances, so hath he appeared wonderful in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for our outward Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Preservations from time to time, who hath bound the Seas with Swadling-bands, and hath said to the proud Waves, <hi>Hitherto shalt thou come, and no farther;</hi> Magnified be the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:192293:8"/> Name of the Lord God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>And so, my dear Friends, on every Hand we are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, obliged People to the Lord, who hath been Digging, Dressing, Pruning and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering us his Vineyard, from Day to Day, from Week to Week, from Assembly to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly; and his Living Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that begun this good Work amongst us, in the Day of our first Tender Visitation, hath been carrying the same on to this Day.</p>
            <p>And now, Dearly Beloved Friends, in every place, this to you is the Message of the Lord of Hosts, the Almighty God, that I have received from his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:192293:8"/> Mouth, and am Necessitated, both by VVord and VVriting, to Sound in the Ears of the People of the Lord God, in this Nation peculiarly, which was the first of the Nations that was Visited in this his Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Glorious <hi>Day,</hi> That the Lord our Righteousness do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his People in every place, <hi>To keep stayed in that Immortal Light of Life, unto which they were directed in the Day of their first Tender Visitation;</hi> in that to feel the Vertue, Power and Efficacy of the Girdle of Truth, to Gird up the Loins of every ones Mind in the Light of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, daily there to wait, to feel the Everlasting Power, and Right Arm of God's Salvation,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192293:9"/> it's Manifestation, Operation, and effectual Working; that so thereby that Good and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Work, which the Lord God began amongst us, in the <hi>Day</hi> of our first tender Visitation (and hath been carrying on to this very Day) may now be finished and perfected; and the residue of that Nature (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which the Sword of the Lord hath been Furbished) might utterly be Destroyed. And dear Friends, in the Name of the Everlasting God, this is the very Work of this <hi>Day,</hi> in and amongst the People of the Lord, and for this End doth the Lord spare many, and lengthens out the Day of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of this Nation (with

            <p>And now, dear Friends, this perfect Salvation is no way at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but as there is an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Way of it, closing with, and being Comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into that Light of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, given to us to profit withal; for, in it is the Power received, in it is the Vertue of Life known, which no Mind is made worthy of the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:192293:10"/> of, but that which can sit at <hi>Jesus</hi>'s Feet, but that Mind which can stoop to the lowest Appearance of Christ Jesus, where the Mind is made as low and little as the Grain of Mustard-seed; here is the Entrance into the Power of Life, that gives Dominion, known; for many miss here, who come not down, so as to be nothing in the Love of this World, nor in any created Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; to be nothing in Thoughts or Imaginations that are Evil, to have no <hi>Dalilah,</hi> no beloved Lust to be as the Right Hand, or as the Right Eye; for where the Mind is in these things En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, it finds not perfectly the Way of Life, the Place of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192293:11"/> Power and Ability to stand over every Defilement and Temptation, of what Nature and Kind soever; for the Door of Hope is found in the Valley, where the Mind, Heart and Thoughts come to be as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their own Eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; here the Power hath its Passage, and here the Spirit of Life hath its free and perfect Operation, to work the Work of God effectually, until Man throughout be Leavened into the Lump of Life, brought up into the very Image of God: So then every one must come to be as a Child; yea, and as a weaned Child too; and here the Work of the Lord in the Heart and Soul goes forward
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:192293:11"/> daily; for the Lord is weary of Out-side Professions, and they are before him as the Fig-Tree, that was covered with <hi>Leaves,</hi> but had <hi>no Fruit,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Christ Jesus said, <hi>Never Man gather Fruit of thee,</hi> and it withered; so will it be with the False and Hypocritical Professions; for none shall be able to stand in the Day of the Lord, that hastens, but such as come to stand in the Possession of Life it self.</p>
            <p>And so, dear Friends, that every one may know the Blood of Sprinkling, that Sprinkles the Conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God in newness of Life; for where the Blood is not known, even
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:192293:12"/> the Life of Jesus, but despised and trodden under Foot, there will the Destroying Angel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Day of his passing through; for the Whirl-wind of his Wrath will be revealed, to fan and sweep away the Wicked, and the Sword of the Lord is bathed in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ungodly: And therefore, Friends, Prize your time, prize your time, waiting daily on the Lord God, that so the Nature of Transgression may be wholly taken away in us, for which the Mighty God hath a Controversie with the Nations; for there will be no Hiding-place for any, but the clean in Heart, in the Day (at hand) of the Dreadful Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:192293:12"/> and Rebukes of the Lord God of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>And, dear Friends, it is upon me to leave this, as the Counsel of the Lord, upon all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Lord's People through this Nation (as may be concerned) That all Heads of Families, or any that have the Tuition of Youth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in their Families and Schools to feel the daily ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God's Immortal Power, in that to Labour (according to their Power) to keep down all Sin and Iniquity in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and in that to feel Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to reach the Witness of God in their Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Families; that so no Sin nor Iniquity may be in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:192293:13"/> Families of the Lord's People, but that all be kept sweet and clean, pure and savoury before the Lord, all in his Fear, Dread and Awe, out of all Needless Discourses, Vain Words, Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Jestings; but let your Words be few, and they Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring Grace to the Hearers; that so, when the People of the World come to your Houses, to have Converse or Commerce with you, all being in the Dread, Fear and Awe of the Lord God, in the Sweet, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, Chast Life, the Witness of God will Arise, and make them acknowledge, you are the People of the Lord, and that he is with you; and here every one in their respective
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:192293:13"/> places will be Preachers of Righteousness, and here, in this pure harmless Life, we must overcome: And this doth the Lord God (in whose Hand is the Breath of all Living) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of all the Families of his People. And where any do, or shall walk in a contrary Life, the Lord God of Eternal Might and Strength will visit with the Rod of Affliction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, dear Friends, it is likewise upon me to warn all, in all places, to be careful, that neither you, nor your Families, run into Superfluities in Meats or in Drinks; or in Apparrel (or into the proud offensive Garbs of the World) but in all these things let us all keep in our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192293:14"/> first Fear, Dread and Awe, that in none of these things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision may be made for the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts thereof.</p>
            <p>And dear Friends, it is also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to warn all, in all places, to beware of trusting, or having a Life in Uncertain Riches, or in any External Thing; and that at all times, and in all places, all keep out of the many and needless Words, both in Dealing, and in all your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and Commerce with the World, let your Words be few: For, Friends, there is a great Hurt fustained in a Multitude of Words; for by it is the Mind drawn forth, and the Spirit of the World let in, through which the continued Sence of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192293:14"/> the Presence of the Lord is lost, and also, our Testimony wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened against the World there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and also, thereby the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity is lost of reaching the Witness of God in the World, on all Occasions of having to do with them.</p>
            <p>And therefore, dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Friends, I beseech all, in the Bowels of the Love of God, in the Moving of God's Eternal Spirit and Power, that in your Dealings you use but few Words; and be Equal, Just and Upright; and do not be drawn forth in many Words, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering that Mind that is out of the Dread and Fear of the Lord; but after you have put a Price on your Commodities,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192293:15"/> which is Equal, and as you can sell them, then if the Persons you are dealing with, multiply Words, stand you Silent in the Fear, Dread and Awe of God, and this will answer the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in them you are dealing with; and if this should not please People at first, yet you will see it will quickly overcome; so that you, in your Dealings therein, keep out of the Spirit of the World, out of all Covetousness, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching and Craftiness in the Harmless Life, seeking the Kingdom daily, and let other things come as Additions: So all being Diligent in the pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And all, Friends, be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over your own Hearts, in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, in the first moving Cause of Marriage, that none that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to walk in the Undefiled Way of the Lord may run into the Lusts of the Flesh, and of the Eye (in which Ground stands all the Polluted Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of the World) but all to try the very Ground of their Love and Affection, whether
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192293:16"/> it stands in the Covenant of God, in the clean Life of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; for although it is the very Truth, that Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is Honourable, the Bed must be Undefiled, which is a near Word, and Judgeth many Marriages in the VVorld, that are begun, carried on, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of the Fear and Dread of the Living God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, Friends, I am moved of the Lord God to warn all, to try the first moving Cause of every ones <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to Marry this or the other Person, and that when it first Springs in their Hearts, when it is in the Bud; for then, if by bringing it to the Light, it be not found approv'd to spring in

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:192293:17"/> Sence of the Truth, so perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth therein to the ruining their Condition in the Truth, and to the displeasing of the Holy Lord God, and causing his dear Name to be Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and to the easing and gratifying of the VVorld; of which Practice I warn all in the Fear and Dread, and by the Power and Spirit of the Lord God, to beware; and all such things will be avoided, as heed is taken in the first Thought to any such thing. And let all know, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever have been, or shall be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this thing; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may be darkened and loose their Sence, yet it is great VVickedness in the sight of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:192293:17"/> Holy Lord God, that is in the midst of us; and with all such will the Lord plead; and a Cup of Trembling from the Hand of the Lord must all such Drink, and know his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Bow them down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perfect Peace with the Lord they know, and before they can recover their former Splendor in the Truth.</p>
            <p>And all, dear Friends every where, whose Hearts are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Concern of God's Truth and People, let the sharp Sword of the Lord be in your Hearts, Hands and Mouths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this thing.</p>
            <p>And, dear Friends, if any see that a single Condition is not best for them, then let all wait
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:192293:18"/> to be guided in the Truth, in the changing their Conditions, and not to run, as the VVorld's People do many times, from Place to Place, and from Person to Person, having their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons residing one while on one Object, and another time on another, and it may be so on too many, which is a wrong thing, and Destruction every way attends it; but all, in the pure Fear of the Lord (that keepeth the Heart clean) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, seeing their way clear and plain in the Sence of Truth, out of all the VVorld's Sleights, and Bargainings, and Folly, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Management of such things.</p>
            <p>And all Masters and Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:192293:18"/> and Heads of Families, all to stand in their places, in the Exercise of a Pure, Meek Spirit to their Servants and Children; not in the Merciless Spirit of the World, who would require of their Servants more then they have Ability to Perform comfortably; but out of that let all keep, in the Love of God, waiting on him for VVisdom, that every one may know their places.</p>
            <p>And all Servants to stand in the subject, diligent State, in Meekness: And I warn all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, professing Truth, to keep low in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, out of High-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Pride, and out of all Eye-service, waiting on the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:192293:19"/> Lord to know your places in all things; and herein you will Adorn the Truth.</p>
            <p>And also it is upon me, in the Fear, Dread and Counsel of the Lord, to warn all, in all places, of that thing <hi>Joseph</hi> warned his Brethren, <hi>viz. Of falling out by the Way;</hi> that there be no way given to the least Appearance of that which would make any Rent, Schism or Division; for every Vessel that shall receive in that Spirit that thirsteth to Envy, that Spirit that hurries into Passions, that Spirit that will Back-bite and VVhisper in Secret, through which Breaches come; the Hand of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is against every such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument; the Dread of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:192293:19"/> Lord of Hosts, as a consuming Fire, will break out against all such Vessels that shall continue in any such Spirit; for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth its Nature is, to bring forth the very contrary Fruits in all such Vessels where it Lives, and Reigns and Rules; all such their Life is Peace, and such are Peace-makers; such cannot rest, or be contented while there stands any thing betwixt them and a <hi>Brother</hi> or <hi>Sister,</hi> if they be concerned therein; such a one, seeing any Iniquity in his Brother or Sister, will, in the tender breaking Bowels of tender Love, go to his Brother or his Sister, and say, <hi>My Brother,</hi> or <hi>My Sister, do not offend or grieve our tender
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:192293:20"/> Father, who hath dealt so tenderly with us:</hi> And so in the Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking Love he will Labour with his Brother, or with his Sister, and if not received, will let no Prejudice nor Anger arise, nor will not shut out his Brother; but if there will be no reception, there will be a single standing in the Love and Simplicity of Truth; and he, or she that shall not so receive, shuts themselves out.</p>
            <p>And if there be a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie between any, where the Life of Truth is known, if there be but the least slyding, yet the most Innocent will be ready to acknowledge, first, that with the Love of God he may break down, and overcome the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:192293:20"/> in his Brother; and this Spirit Ruling, which is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Saviour of the World, no rent, schism or division can Live, or have an existence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People of the Lord; against which Spirit, that causes Division, the Hand of the Lord is and Wo from God to all whose Hearts and Spirits do not subject, which seeks Peace, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:192293:21"/> there would be Gladness were there an Opportunity so to do; so that, dear Friends, all may dwell together in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the One Eternal Spirit of Life and Peace, in which to feel their Hearts United; for he, or she that loveth not their Brother, how dwelleth the Love of God in them?

            <p>And all, Friends, every where, quench not the Spirit of the Lord in your selves, nor in one another; nor let any resist or judge the Power of the Lord God, although in a tender Babe, that cannot yet speak plain; for where any do thus hurt the tender Lamps of Christ's Fold, and stop the bublings up of Life, it brings a Barrenness over their own Souls, and over such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies they belong unto.</p>

And now, dear Friends every where, unto You, and to the Generation coming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I have this Warning and tender Advice to leave behind me, in the Name of my God, that hath been with me in my Travels, in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Work and Labour of the Gospel of Life and Salvation. Keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace; and let none give way to a prejudicing Spirit which leads into secret Whisperings, Back-bitings,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:192293:33"/> and such like Evil, and pernicious Fruits, the Working of which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is like a Moth in a Garment, dividing, destroying, spoyling and eating up; for indeed, as <hi>Zion</hi> is a City at Unity with it self, under the seamless Garment of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and there all are well and safe, growing, increasing and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so when the Spirit abovesaid prevails to draw out of <hi>Zion</hi>'s Gates, and from within her Walls of Salvation: Oh! what deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Work and Havock will it make in its Growth and Progress; work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I said before of the Moth, gradually and secretly first; but as it prevaileth and increaseth in its growth and strength, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as a roaring, devouring Lyon, seeking whom it may devour and swallow up.</p>

And therefore, Friends, I say unto you, in the Name of the the Lord God Eternal, let none give strength, or any incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or nourishment any way to this Spirit in any of its murthering Workings in any Heart, but let it be looked on as a Vagabond and Fugitive in the Earth; and so as it is kept out of the Camp of God, and from <hi>Israel</hi>'s Dwellings, by the sweet, living, bright Power of the great God of Heaven and Earth, it will perish under Truth, Judgment set up in every Soul, and so the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:192293:34"/> thereof, as well as its evil ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and dividing Fruits will be worn out, and destroyed for ever: And then all keeping in the first Love, pure Fear, living Awe, and holy Dread, fearing to offend our God and tender Father, perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in an inward keeping the holy Watch, and abiding in Subjection and Obedience to the Spiritual Cross, in staidness of Mind, sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Judgment, and clearness in Understanding, you See Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and Fathom all the Enemies Devices, Temptations and Snares; and the Lord God beholding you in a stedfast Habitation of Obedience, and spiritual Tenderness before him, his Power will descend won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully in an increasing manner, and his Glory will Shine, his River of Life Flow; yea, the Spring of the great Deep will be broken up, and the Windows of Heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

And here you shall spend the residue of your Days in Dominion over both the Snares of the Enemy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Prosperity and Liberty, Adversity and Persecution; seeing over all things that have their Rise in Mortality and Time; feeling Mortality swallowed up of Life Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and so gathered to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly, to the Church of the First Born, to the Spirits of just Men made Perfect; yea, to the First and Last, God the Judge of all, to whom be immortal high Praises, and holy Renown, for ever and for evermore. But if the wonderful Blessings, tender Mercies, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:192293:35"/> Loving Kindnesses that the Lord God Almighty every way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends unto us in this Age, be not duely, reverently and obediently taken notice of; but instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, any shall forsake, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of the Lord's tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and thereby Imbrace lying Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, going out of the Spiritual Diligence into a Spiritual Idleness, through which a Spiritual Slumber overtakes, and the Lamp thereby be inwardly Neglected, the Spiritual Watch and Cross slighted, and not duly regarded, but the Earth and Earthly things take up the Exercise of the Mind and Affections: Then, I say, instead of injoyning what is above expressed, Tribulation and Anguish will seize upon all such, and the dreadful Judgment of the Eternal God that Lives for ever and ever, will overtake all such Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness. A Dreadful Cup ye
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:192293:35"/> shall Drink of from the Hand of God, and Distress from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of the Lord shall Distress you; and you shall be numbered amongst the People of his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in his dreadful approaching Day of signal Pleadings with all Flesh that have Corrupted its way before him; and therefore Hear, Fear, and Dread the Holy Name of the Lord; and, whil'st it's called to Day, bow before him, and speedily return unto him, lest your Day pass over, and ye Sleep the Sleep of Eternal Death and Destruction, and be separated for ever from his Refreshing Presence, (in which is Life) and from the Glory of his divine Power.</p>
            <p>Therefore all, dear Friends, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where retire Inwardly, See, Feel and Understand the Counsel of the Lord, which unto you Springs; all retire inward (that are not there)
